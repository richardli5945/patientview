        The Forum broke with this week's update. We're not rushing to fix it - we had already posted messages saying we were thinking of closing it, and few disagreed.

    <p>
        People have recommended two very good alternatives: the Renal Patient Support Group on Facebook, and the KPG forum at <a href="http://www.kidneypatientguide.org.uk/forum" target="_blank">http://www.kidneypatientguide.org.uk/forum</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Both are really active and supportive.
